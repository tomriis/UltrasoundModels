# UltrasoundModels

Simulations of ultrasound transducer arrays. The simulations are performed in [FieldII] (http://field-ii.dk), [FOCUS](https://www.egr.msu.edu/~fultras-web/), and [KWave](http://www.k-wave.org/). This project also includes a GUI to view simulation results and search through these images via parameters of the array.
